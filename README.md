# Student Job Tracker

A beginner-friendly React and Vite mini project for exploring sample internships and tracking applications in the browser.

> The internship listings are sample records for demonstration and are not verified live vacancies.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. To create a production build, run `npm run build`.

## Features

- Search sample internships by job title or company and combine category and location filters.
- Add applications with required-field and email validation.
- Filter applications by status and confirm before deleting.
- Persist tracked applications in browser localStorage.
- Use responsive navigation and layouts on desktop and mobile.
